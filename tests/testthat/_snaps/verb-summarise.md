# summarise(.groups=)

    Code
      eval_bare(expr(lazy_frame(x = 1, y = 2) %>% dplyr::group_by(x, y) %>% dplyr::summarise() %>%
        remote_query()), env(global_env()))
    Message
      `summarise()` has grouped output by "x". You can override using the `.groups` argument.
    Output
      <SQL> SELECT `x`, `y`
