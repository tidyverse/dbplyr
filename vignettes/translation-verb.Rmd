There are two parts to dbplyr SQL translation: translating dplyr verbs, and translating expressions within those verbs. This vignette describes how entire verbs are translated; `vignette("translation-function")` describes how individual expressions within those verbs are translated.

All dplyr verbs generate a `SELECT` statement. To demonstrate we'll make a temporary database with a couple of tables

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
flights <- copy_to(con, nycflights13::flights)
airports <- copy_to(con, nycflights13::airports)
```

## Single table verbs

*  `select()` and `mutate()` modify the `SELECT` clause:

    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      select(contains("delay")) %>%
      show_query()
    
    flights %>%
      select(distance, air_time) %>%  
      mutate(speed = distance / (air_time / 60)) %>%
      show_query()
    ```
    
*  `filter()` generates a `WHERE` clause:
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      filter(month == 1, day == 1) %>%
      show_query()
    ```

*  `arrange()` generates an `ORDER BY` clause:

    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      arrange(carrier, desc(arr_delay)) %>%
      show_query()
    ```

*  `summarise()` and `group_by()` work together to generate a `GROUP BY` clause:

    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      group_by(month, day) %>%
      summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
      show_query()
    ```

## Dual table verbs

| R                | SQL
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| `inner_join()`   | `SELECT * FROM x JOIN y ON x.a = y.a`
| `left_join()`    | `SELECT * FROM x LEFT JOIN y ON x.a = y.a`
| `right_join()`   | `SELECT * FROM x RIGHT JOIN y ON x.a = y.a`
| `full_join()`    | `SELECT * FROM x FULL JOIN y ON x.a = y.a`
| `semi_join()`    | `SELECT * FROM x WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM y WHERE x.a = y.a)`
| `anti_join()`    | `SELECT * FROM x WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM y WHERE x.a = y.a)`
| `intersect(x, y)`| `SELECT * FROM x INTERSECT SELECT * FROM y`
| `union(x, y)`    | `SELECT * FROM x UNION SELECT * FROM y`
| `setdiff(x, y)`  | `SELECT * FROM x EXCEPT SELECT * FROM y`

`x` and `y` don't have to be tables in the same database. If you specify `copy = TRUE`, dplyr will copy the `y` table into the same location as the `x` variable. This is useful if you've downloaded a summarised dataset and determined a subset of interest that you now want the full data for. You can use `semi_join(x, y, copy = TRUE)` to upload the indices of interest to a temporary table in the same database as `x`, and then perform a efficient semi join in the database. 

If you're working with large data, it maybe also be helpful to set `auto_index = TRUE`. That will automatically add an index on the join variables to the temporary table.

## Behind the scenes

The verb level SQL translation is implemented on top of `tbl_lazy`, which basically tracks the operations you perform in a pipeline (see `lazy-ops.R`). Turning that into a SQL query takes place in three steps:

* `sql_build()` recurses over the lazy op data structure building up query 
  objects (`select_query()`, `join_query()`, `set_op_query()` etc) 
  that represent the different subtypes of `SELECT` queries that we might
  generate.

* `sql_optimise()` takes a pass over these SQL objects, looking for potential
  optimisations. Currently this only involves removing subqueries where
  possible.

* `sql_render()` calls an SQL generation function (`sql_query_select()`,
  `sql_query_join()`, `sql_query_semi_join()`, `sql_query_set_op()`, ...)
  to produce the actual SQL. Each of these functions is a generic, taking 
  the connection as an argument, so that the translation can be customised 
  for different databases.
