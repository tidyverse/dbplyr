\usage{
dialect_impala()

simulate_impala()
}
\description{
See \code{vignette("translation-function")} and \code{vignette("translation-verb")} for
details of overall translation technology. Key differences for this backend
are a scattering of custom translations provided by users, mostly focussed
on bitwise operations.

Use \code{simulate_impala()} with \code{lazy_frame()} to see simulated SQL without
converting to live access database.
}
\examples{
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

lf <- lazy_frame(a = TRUE, b = 1, c = 2, d = "z", con = simulate_impala())
lf |> transmute(X = bitwNot(bitwOr(b, c)))
}
