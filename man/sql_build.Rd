  x,
  y,
  vars,
  type = "inner",
  by = NULL,
  suffix = c(".x", ".y"),
  na_matches = FALSE

sql_optimise(x, con = NULL, ..., subquery = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{op}{A sequence of lazy operations}

\item{con}{A database connection. The default \code{NULL} uses a set of
rules that should be very similar to ANSI 92, and allows for testing
without an active database connection.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to the methods. Not currently used.}

\item{subquery}{Is this SQL going to be used in a subquery?
This is important because you can place a bare table name in a subquery
and  ORDER BY does not work in subqueries.}
}
\description{
\code{sql_build()} creates a \code{select_query} S3 object, that is rendered
to a SQL string by \code{sql_render()}. The output from \code{sql_build()} is
designed to be easy to test, as it's database agnostic, and has
a hierarchical structure. Outside of testing, however, you should
always call \code{sql_render()}.
}
\details{
\code{sql_build()} is generic over the lazy operations, \link{lazy_ops},
and generates an S3 object that represents the query. \code{sql_render()}
takes a query object and then calls a function that is generic
over the database. For example, \code{sql_build.op_mutate()} generates
a \code{select_query}, and \code{sql_render.select_query()} calls
\code{sql_select()}, which has different methods for different databases.
The default methods should generate ANSI 92 SQL where possible, so you
backends only need to override the methods if the backend is not ANSI
compliant.
